### TicTacToe
This is an unbeatable TicTacToe game built in Sinatra.  

####To run it on your localhost:

1. Clone this repo to your computer
2. Run ``shotgun`` from the root directory
3. Open [http://localhost:9393/](http://localhost:9393/) in your browser

Important note: This application requires Ruby 2.0.0 and Sinatra, in addition to a few gems (which can be viewed in the gemfile).  You will also need RSpec to run the test suite.  You can install many of these simply by running ``bundle`` from the root directory.

####Running the tests

As previously mentioned, you will need RSpec to run the test suite.  Assuming you have already bundled, you should be able to run all the tests with ``rspec spec``.
